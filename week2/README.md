3.vim-javascript--syntax
4.vim-javascript
5.syntastic
6.tern_for_vim
7.autoclose

Why I chose these Plugins

1. Vundle is a vim plugin manager, it allows you to keep tack of and configure
   plugins using .vimrc. Allows for install/update/search and run plugins. The
   main reason behind using vundle was to allow plugins to be managed easier.
2. YouCompleteMe fuzzy-search code completetion engine for Vim. In my case, it
   has a tern-based completion engine for JavaScript. The reason for using this
   plugin was because sometimes I'll forget a particular method but with
   YouCompleteMe it will provide the methods in a dropdown menu
3. Vim-javascript--syntax is a syntax highlighting plugin. The reason for using
   this plugin was because it allows parenthesis,curly and regular brackets,
   semicollins to be highlighted. Easy to track where each statement
   opens/closes
4. vim-javascript complements the plugin above and adds a tiny bit more
   highlighting
5. syntasic is a syntax checking plugin for Vim. Highlights errors in my code
   red
6. tern_for_vim works with YouCompleteMe which allows javascript to be parsed
   properly.
7. autoclose closes brackets, parenthesis etc
