Reflect on and improve your focus

There are six steps in the technique:

1. Decide on the task to be done.
2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
3. Work on the task until the timer rings.
4. After the timer rings put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.
6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

Above is the steps I followed when using the PROMODO technique

Personally I really like this technique and I think it works well with
programming, especially if you become stuck on a particular part of your project
and are unable to move onto the next part due to some error. Using this
technique allows you focus for 25 minutes than have a break. Sometimes a break
as short as 5 minutes allows you refocus and when you come back are able to see
where error was happening.

I think that was the key to this technique working for me. I knew that I had 25
minutes to get my work done and that I would be rewarded with a break dependent
on the amount of checkmarks.

One negative thing when using the technique, sometimes i would be caught
thinking about how much time I had left, thats just a personal tendancy I have.
So sometimes it would through my focus off. To fix this I put my phone which had
the timer out of reach and only relied on the sound of the alarm.
